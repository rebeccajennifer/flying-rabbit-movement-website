## FAQ

### Why handstands?

They cultivate smiles. They can be done anywhere. Handstand training builds a discipline that can lead to a more fulfilling life.

### Can I really learn how to do a handstand?

Of course! Handstands just require a specific mix of strength, mobility, and motor control. I will work with you at your level to develop these fundamental skills.

### How often should I practice?

You can see significant progress with just 10 minutes of practice, two to four times a week.

### Are there any prerequisites?

There are a few, but not as many as you might think. You just need basic wrist and shoulder mobility along with some upper body strength. Locomotion is a great place to start if you are new to being upside down. If you have concerns about specific limitations, I am happy to discuss them via email.

### How will handstands help me grow?

Learning this skill requires consistent, intentional practice. It teaches patience and trust in the process. These intangible results will permeate other areas of your life. I promise.
