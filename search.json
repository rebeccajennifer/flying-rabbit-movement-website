    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat is Locomotion?\nTechnically, locomotion is the act of moving from one location to another. To me, it is basically crawling like an animal. This practice allows you to reclaim natural movement by developing strength, mobility, and motor control that translate directly into your everyday life.\n\n\nWhat is physical autonomy?\nPhysical autonomy is the ability to do all the things that are important to you. It might be picking something up off the floor without wincing or playing a neighborhood game of soccer and not feeling broken the next day. No matter what your goals are, locomotion can help you progress toward them.\n\n\nWhat is motor control?\nMotor control is the ability to get your body to do what your brain is telling it to do. It is like being able to pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time. Practicing locomotion develops this skill, increasing the efficiency and ease of all your movements.\n\n\nHow does locomotion do it all?\nGMB locomotion uses four basic movements: Bear, Monkey, Frogger, and Crab. There are endless variations of these exercises and ways to link them together. Each movement simultaneously engages the upper body, core, and lower body in unique ways."

    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhy handstands?\nThey cultivate smiles. They can be done anywhere. Handstand training builds a discipline that can lead to a more fulfilling life.\n\n\nCan I really learn how to do a handstand?\nOf course! Handstands just require a specific mix of strength, mobility, and motor control. I will work with you at your level to develop these fundamental skills.\n\n\nHow often should I practice?\nYou can see significant progress with just 10 minutes of practice, two to four times a week.\n\n\nAre there any prerequisites?\nThere are a few, but not as many as you might think. You just need basic wrist and shoulder mobility along with some upper body strength. Locomotion is a great place to start if you are new to being upside down. If you have concerns about specific limitations, I am happy to discuss them via email.\n\n\nHow will handstands help me grow?\nLearning this skill requires consistent, intentional practice. It teaches patience and trust in the process. These intangible results will permeate other areas of your life. I promise."
